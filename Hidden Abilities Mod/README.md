version 1.0.0

first working version of mod

this mod changes the sprite of all abilities attached to players to a "?" sprite so nobody knows what abilities anyone has.
once the ability is dropped on death, its original sprite is still visible.

extensive testing has not been performed yet, will need to be.

planning on adding config options in later versions that allow for options like hiding only non-local player sprites, hiding the ability's sprite on drop, etc.
